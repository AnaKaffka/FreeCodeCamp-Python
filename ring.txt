From its epic scale and unmatched sense of adventure to its beloved characters and the unforgettable 
relationships between them, Lord of the Rings remains the all-time best series of fantasy films. Now, 21 years 
after The Fellowship of the Ring, LotR is back in the zeitgeist thanks to Amazon’s great new Middle-earth TV 
series, The Rings of Power.

Watching the Lord of the Rings movies in order is a fairly straightforward endeavor, and we’ve put together 
this article to make sure newcomers can properly navigate both The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit trilogies. 
With series newcomers in mind, the brief plot synopses below will be spoiler-free beyond broad plot points and 
character introductions.

At the bottom of the article, you'll find a second list that orders the films by their actual release dates, 
if you’d prefer to watch them in that order instead (as I do).

There are six total movies set within J.R.R. Tolkein’s Middle-earth: three The Lord of the Rings movies and 
three The Hobbit movies. There is also the 1997 animated film, The Hobbit, which is separate from the newer 
films. No future movies are planned, though Amazon does currently have its Rings of Power series heading into 
season 2 already.

Amazon’s Rings of Power series is set during the Second Age of Middle-earth, thousands of years before the 
events of Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit -- which is set in the third age. This is the period in Middle-earth
during which we’ll see "the forging of the rings, the rise of the Dark Lord Sauron, the epic tale of Númenor, 
and the Last Alliance of Elves and Men," according to showrunners J.D. Payne and Patrick McKay.
